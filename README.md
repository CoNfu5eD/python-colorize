# python-colorize
A basic python script for colorizing text on terminal/cmd.

Basically this where my first steps with python,
I just wanted to get colorized text on the Windows cmd.

It also works in linux terminal and I think it will work on mac terminal too but I have no mac, so.. untested for mac.
